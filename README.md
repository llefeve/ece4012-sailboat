ROS and MOOS code for an autonomous sailboat project created under the 
direction of Dr. Michael West at the Georgia Institute of Technology.


The catkin_ws subdirectory contains all of the required ROS code to interface with 
the various sensors and motors used throughout the project.

The moos-ros-bridge subdirectory trasnfers all the the published rostopics to the active 
MOOSDB for use in any given mission.
